ASSEMBLY NOTES:
"1. All coordinates in millimeters (mm)"
"2. Rotation in degrees (0, 90, 180, 270)"
"3. Layer: Top side only for SMD components"
"4. Mid X, Mid Y: Component center position"
"5. Origin (0,0) at bottom-left corner of PCB"

CRITICAL ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:
"1. Apply solder paste using stencil (0.125mm thickness)"
"2. Place components in order: smallest to largest"
"3. Check polarity of electrolytic capacitor C1 (marked on body)"
"4. Check orientation of ICs (pin 1 indicator)"
"5. MOC3041 optocouplers MUST be oriented correctly (pin 1 dot)"
"6. Reflow profile: Lead-free SAC305, peak 250°C for 30-60 seconds"
"7. Inspect for solder bridges, tombstoning, misalignment"
"8. Measure resistance between AC and DC sections (>10MΩ required)"

THROUGH-HOLE COMPONENTS (HAND SOLDERING REQUIRED):
"U6 - ESP32-WROOM-32 at X=40.0, Y=9.0"
"Q1 - TRIAC BTA16 at X=25.0, Y=43.0"
"Q2 - TRIAC BTA16 at X=30.0, Y=43.0"
"Q3 - TRIAC BTA16 at X=35.0, Y=43.0"
"Q4 - TRIAC BTA16 at X=40.0, Y=43.0"
"PS1 - HLK-PM01 at X=8.0, Y=38.5"
"F2 - 10A Fuse at X=4.0, Y=42.5"
"J1 - AC Input Terminal at X=3.0, Y=42.5"
"J2 - AC Output Terminal at X=65.0, Y=40.0"
"J3 - Switch Connector at X=63.0, Y=5.0"

FAIL-SAFE VERIFICATION:
"1. Visual inspection: No solder bridges between AC and DC zones"
"2. Continuity: All ground connections <1Ω"
"3. Isolation: AC to DC >10MΩ"
"4. Power test: 5V ±0.1V at ESP32 input"
"5. Zero-cross test: 100Hz/120Hz signal at GPIO 13"
"6. TRIAC test: All 4 channels switch properly"

QUALITY CONTROL CHECKPOINTS:
"✓ Solder paste application uniform and complete"
"✓ No component misalignment (tolerance ±0.5mm)"
"✓ No tombstoning on 0805/1206 parts"
"✓ No solder bridges on IC pins"
"✓ Polarity correct on electrolytic capacitor"
"✓ IC orientation correct (pin 1 marking visible)"
"✓ Thermal vias not filled with solder (must remain open)"
"✓ Isolation barrier clear of solder/flux residue"
