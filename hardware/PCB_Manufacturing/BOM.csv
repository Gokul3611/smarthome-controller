ASSEMBLY NOTES:
"1. All SMD components can be assembled by JLCPCB PCBA service"
"2. Through-hole components (ESP32, TRIACs, connectors) require hand soldering or wave soldering"
"3. Thermal paste required between TRIACs and PCB thermal vias"
"4. Conformal coating recommended on AC section for moisture protection"
"5. All components are RoHS compliant and lead-free compatible"

CRITICAL COMPONENTS (MUST match firmware):
"- ESP32-WROOM-32: Firmware expects specific GPIO pins"
"- MOC3041: Zero-cross switching is REQUIRED for snubberless operation"
"- BTA16-600B: Adequate current rating (16A) with safety margin"
"- HLK-PM01: Isolated power supply critical for safety"

FAIL-SAFE FEATURES:
"- Dual 470kΩ resistors: Redundancy in zero-cross detection"
"- MOV surge protection: Voltage spike clamping"
"- Multiple fuses: Overcurrent protection at multiple levels"
"- 6mm isolation barrier: Physical separation AC/DC"
"- Thermal vias: Heat dissipation under TRIACs"
"- Ground plane: Low impedance return path"

SUBSTITUTIONS ALLOWED:
"- BTA16-600B can be replaced with BT136, Q4008L (similar specs)"
"- PC817C can be PC817A/B (all variants work)"
"- DF04M can be any 1A 400V SMD bridge"
"- Resistors/capacitors: Any manufacturer with same specs"

DO NOT SUBSTITUTE:
"- ESP32-WROOM-32 (firmware specific)"
"- MOC3041 (zero-cross required, not MOC3021/3023)"
"- HLK-PM01 (safety certified, specific footprint)"
