# Debug APK Directory

This directory contains debug builds of the Smart Home Controller Android app.

## Naming Convention

Debug APKs should follow this naming pattern:
```
smart-home-controller-v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-debug.apk
```

Examples:
- `smart-home-controller-v1.0.0-debug.apk`
- `smart-home-controller-v1.0.1-debug.apk`
- `smart-home-controller-v2.0.0-debug.apk`

## Building Debug APK

From the Flutter project directory:
```bash
cd "frontend/flutter project/demo"
flutter build apk --debug
cp build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk ../../../app/debug/smart-home-controller-v1.0.0-debug.apk
```

## APK Characteristics

Debug APKs are:
- ✅ Include debug symbols
- ✅ Can be debugged with Android Studio
- ✅ Easier to test and diagnose issues
- ✅ Hot reload support in development
- ❌ Larger file size
- ❌ Not optimized for performance
- ❌ Should not be used in production

## Use Cases

Debug APKs are useful for:
- Development and testing
- Bug reproduction and debugging
- Internal QA testing
- Pre-release validation
- Logging and diagnostics

**Note:** APK files are not committed to the repository. This directory exists to provide a consistent location for placing built APKs.
