## 5.0 Key Technical Decisions

### 5.1 Architecture Choices

1. **ESP32 as Controller**
   - **Why**: Affordable, dual-core, built-in WiFi/BT
   - **Alternatives considered**: Arduino + WiFi module, Raspberry Pi
   - **Trade-offs**: More complex programming vs capability

2. **Google Apps Script Backend**
   - **Why**: Free, scalable, no server maintenance
   - **Alternatives considered**: AWS, Firebase, custom server
   - **Trade-offs**: 6-minute runtime limit vs zero cost

3. **Google Sheets as Database**
   - **Why**: Easy to use, built-in backup, visual management
   - **Alternatives considered**: MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase
   - **Trade-offs**: Query speed vs simplicity

4. **Flutter for Mobile App**
   - **Why**: Cross-platform (iOS + Android), modern UI
   - **Alternatives considered**: Native Android, React Native
   - **Trade-offs**: Learning curve vs code reuse
